### Basic Info

GFUR is a simple database I made to store GFUR so I can access it easier. I will be adding custom image hosting to it sometime in the future. I will be trying to update this site weekly, but for now it has just come out of Alpha.

### Further Info

gfur.xyz was coded from scratch in PHP, jQuery, CSS & SQL only using VSC and Xampp. No website builders were used in this project.  gfur.xyz is hosted on a custom hosting branch that I created myself to save money.
